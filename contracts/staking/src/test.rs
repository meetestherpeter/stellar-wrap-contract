//! Tests for the staking contract.
//!
//! Paused behaviour (issue #874):
//! - `stake` is blocked while paused: opening new positions during a pause is
//!   defensible because it is a new commitment, not a user's existing funds.
//! - `unstake` is blocked while paused: it mutates the active position and
//!   starts the unbonding clock, so it is treated like `stake`.
//! - `withdraw_stake` is allowed while paused: the stake is already unbonded
//!   and the user is only reclaiming their own funds. Blocking it would trap
//!   user funds for the duration of the pause, which is not justifiable.
